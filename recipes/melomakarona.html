    Melomakarona (μελομακάρονα) are traditional Greek Christmas cookies, 
    that are served during Christmas time throughout Greece. The word 
    “melomakarona” is a combination of the two words “meli”, which means 
    honey and “makarona”. “Makarona” comes from the ancient word “makaria” 
    and means blessed.

    <li>
      To prepare this melomakarona recipe start by making the syrup first. 
      In a pot add all the ingredients for the syrup, besides the honey and 
      bring to the boil. Boil for 3-4 minutes, until the sugar has dissolved 
      and remove from the stove. Stir in the honey and set aside to cool completely.
    </li>
    <li>
      Prepare the dough for the melomakarona. In a bowl add the semolina, 
      flour and baking powder and mix with a whisk to combine.
    </li>
    <li>
      In another large bowl add the orange juice, the cognac, the sugar and spices 
      (nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, vanilla) and mix. Add the baking soda and whisk 
      immediately for 5-10 seconds until the ingredients combine and the baking 
      soda dissolves and starts to foam. Pour in the bowl the water, the oil, 
      the orange zest and honey and whisk to combine.
    </li>
    <li>
      Now it’s time to combine the two mixtures. Add the mixed flour, semolina 
      and baking powder (from step 2) in the bowl with the rest of the ingredients 
      from step 3 and start kneading the dough for the melomakarona. Knead the 
      dough for the melomakarona using your hands, until the ingredients combine 
      and the dough is smooth and soft and slightly sticky. Be careful not to 
      overwork the dough as they will become tough.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preheat the oven at 180C / 356F. Layer the bottom of 4 large baking trays 
      with parchment paper and start shaping the melomakarona. Pinch a portion 
      of dough about the size of a walnut - 30g / 1oz and shape with your palms 
      into a smooth oblong shape, like a small egg. Place on the baking tray, 
      push lightly the top with a fork and pierce three times on top about half 
      way through the dough. Continue with the rest of the dough.
    </li>
    <li>
      Depending on how large on oven you have when your first two trays are ready 
      you can start baking them. Place the baking trays with the melomakarona in 
      the oven and bake for approx. 15-20 minutes, until the melomakarona are 
      lightly and evenly browned and cooked through. If you’ve made them bigger, 
      you’ll need to bump up the cooking time!!
    </li>
    <li>
      When the melomakarona come out of the oven, dip them 
      immediately in the cold syrup, flipping them with a 
      slotted spoon to absorb the syrup for approx. 10-20 seconds, 
      depending on how syrupy you like them. Remove the cookies using a 
      slotted spoon, place on a platter and sprinkle with chopped walnuts.
    </li>
    <li>
      While you are dipping your first couple of tray in the syrup add the next 
      two in the oven to bake. Don’t forget to set your timer!!
    </li>
    <li>
      Store the melomakarona at room temperature in an airtight container. 
      They will keep for all your Christmas Holidays!
